# ODIN Flow — Usage Guide

> **Audience:** engineers who want to _operate_ ODIN Flow.
> For how it works internally, see [../tech/INTERNALS.md](../tech/INTERNALS.md).

ODIN Flow is a GitHub Copilot agent skill suite that automates the
**Figma → Design System → Storybook** pipeline. You drive it from Copilot Chat in VS Code
with a single slash command and a Figma frame URL; an orchestrator (ODIN-9000) decides which
sub-skills to run and sequences them.

## 1. What it does

You point ODIN at a Figma node. Depending on what that node needs, ODIN runs some or all of
four worker skills in dependency order, then (optionally) hands you back component code.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Fig[Figma node<br/>URL or node-id] --> ODIN{{ODIN-9000<br/>orchestrator}}
    ODIN --> MODI[MODI<br/>wireframe → components]
    MODI --> VALI[VALI<br/>groups → Auto Layout]
    VALI --> MIMR[MIMR<br/>token audit + write]
    MIMR --> SAGA[SAGA<br/>HTML/CSS · Stencil · Storybook]
    SAGA --> Out[Component files<br/>+ stories]
    ODIN --> VOLUNDR[VOLUNDR<br/>FDS component docs]
    VOLUNDR --> DocOut[Documentation frames<br/>in Figma]

    classDef orch fill:#ffe9a8,stroke:#8a6d00,color:#000

    class ODIN orch
    class MODI,VALI,MIMR,SAGA work
    class VOLUNDR doc
```

You rarely run all four. ODIN picks the subset your node actually needs (see
[§4](#4-the-skills) and [§5](#5-how-you-invoke-them)).

## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1 Figma for VS Code (the MCP bridge)

The skills read and write Figma through the **Figma for VS Code** extension's MCP server.

1. VS Code → Extensions (`Cmd+Shift+X`) → search **"Figma for VS Code"** (publisher: Figma) → **Install**.
2. Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) → **"Figma: Sign In"** → authenticate.

Or via CLI:

```bash
code --install-extension figma.figma-vscode-extension
```

> The Figma MCP server starts automatically when you open a Copilot Chat session after signing in.

### 2.2 A Figma Personal Access Token (PAT)

MIMR also talks to the Figma **REST API** directly (to read Token Studio `sharedPluginData`),
which needs a PAT separate from the MCP login.

1. [figma.com](https://figma.com) → avatar → **Settings** → **Security** → **Personal access tokens**.
2. **Generate new token**, name it (e.g. `odinflow-agent`), set an expiry.
3. Copy it — it starts with `figd_`.

> **Keep your PAT private.** Paste it directly when ODIN asks; it is referenced by file
> (`.odin-session`, gitignored), never printed back. See [§8](#8-session--pat-handling).

### 2.3 (Optional) Prime the Librarian mirror

Librarian answers token/KB lookups from a **local clone** of the external Token Studio JSON and
KB repos, so the large source files never enter the model context.

```bash
bash .github/prompts/.hermes/sync-kb.sh          # refresh only if the remote SHA changed
bash .github/prompts/.hermes/sync-kb.sh --force  # re-pull regardless of SHA
```

This sparse-checks-out only the token/KB directories into `.github/prompts/.hermes/cache/`
(gitignored) and records the synced SHAs in `cache/kb-manifest.json`.

> The design-system source repos are **private** — the sync needs authenticated git access
> (SSH key or `gh auth login`). Without access, Librarian falls back to the local
> `token-registry.md`.

### 2.4 Clone and open

```bash
git clone git@github.com:karlmalotabs/odin-9000-flow.git
cd odin-9000-flow
code .
```

## 3. Quickstart

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant ODIN as ODIN-9000
    participant Figma as Figma MCP
    You->>ODIN: /odin-9000  + paste Figma frame URL
    ODIN->>Figma: get_metadata (connectivity probe)
    ODIN->>You: ask for PAT (first run only)
    ODIN->>ODIN: Plan — pick skills for this node
    loop per planned skill
        ODIN->>Figma: dispatch worker (read/write)
        Figma-->>ODIN: digest
        ODIN->>You: progress (Kevin-narrated)
    end
    ODIN->>You: summary + any open issues
```

1. Open Copilot Chat in VS Code.
2. Type `/odin-9000` and paste a Figma frame URL (or `file_key` + `node-id`).
3. On the **first run** ODIN asks for your PAT and saves a `.odin-session` (gitignored).
4. ODIN plans, runs the needed skills one at a time, and reports a summary plus any
   `openIssues` to pick up later.

A Figma design URL looks like:
`https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>/<name>?node-id=<nodeId>` — ODIN extracts `fileKey`
and `nodeId` for you (it converts the `-` in the `node-id` param to `:`).

## 4. The skills

| Skill         | Slash command | Use it when…                                                                                                    | Default model     |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **ODIN-9000** | `/odin-9000`  | Always — the orchestrator that runs everything else                                                             | Claude Opus 4.8   |
| **MODI**      | `/modi`       | A wireframe has placeholder shapes, or instances need migrating to a new component version                      | Claude Haiku 4.5  |
| **VALI**      | `/vali`       | Layers are unstructured GROUPs / absolute frames that need semantic Auto Layout before tokenizing               | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| **MIMR**      | `/mimr`       | Tokens changed, bindings are missing, or you need a bulk token migration / audit                                | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| **SAGA**      | `/saga`       | A component is ready (post-VALI + post-MIMR) and you want HTML/CSS, a StencilJS component, or a Storybook story | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| **VOLUNDR**   | `/volundr`    | Generate or update FDS-style component documentation directly on the component's Figma page                      | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| **Librarian** | _(automatic)_ | A token value or KB fact is missing — ODIN/MIMR dispatch it for you; not user-invocable                         | Claude Haiku 4.5  |
| **Kevin**     | `/kevin …`    | A persona/verbosity overlay on narration — always on by default                                                 | _(no model)_      |

**MODI — Model-to-Object Design Instantiator.** Resolves placeholder rectangles/ellipses to real
FDS library components and swaps existing instances to newer versions with full variant-axis
mapping. Resolution strategy: cached component map → design-system search → interactive prompt.

**VALI — Visual Alignment & Layout Instantiator.** Converts GROUPs and unwired FRAMEs into
semantic Auto Layout frames named with the `{direction / role}` convention (`section`, `group`,
`pattern`). Preserves absolute-positioned children and wrapped rows.

**MIMR — Metadata Inventory & Mapping Repository.** Two-pass token engine: combines the Figma
REST API + Token Studio shared plugin data with the Plugin API native-variable resolution to
produce a merged conflict report, then performs rule-driven bulk token writes.

**SAGA — Storybook Automation & Generative Asset.** Generates semantic HTML + vanilla CSS +
CSS Modules, **or** a StencilJS Web Component folder (`fds-{name}.tsx` + `.css` + `.stories.ts`),
deriving `--fds-*` CSS custom properties directly from native-variable bindings.

**VOLUNDR — Documentation Generator.** Creates FDS-style component documentation directly on
the component's own Figma page. Runs in 3 phases: Phase 1 extracts variant structure and control
props from the component; Phase 2 shows a text preview for user confirmation; Phase 3 writes the
documentation frames (Component Header, Control Props table, Variants, optional Building Blocks)
following the FDS template structure. Can be invoked directly or dispatched by ODIN.

## 5. How you invoke them

There are two ways to run work:

### Orchestrated (recommended)

Run `/odin-9000`. ODIN reads the node, **plans** which skills apply, and runs them in
`pipelineOrder` (MODI → VALI → MIMR → SAGA), forwarding each stage's output to the next so the
next worker doesn't re-read Figma. This is the path that records run state and lessons.

ODIN's decision logic, in plain terms:

| Your node / intent                | Skills ODIN runs                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Wireframe with placeholder shapes | MODI → VALI _(if layout needs work)_ |
| Existing instances to migrate     | MODI → VALI _(if layout changed)_    |
| Layout **and** tokens needed      | VALI → MIMR                          |
| Tokens only                       | MIMR                                 |
| Layout only                       | VALI                                 |
| Instance swap only                | MODI                                 |
| Full design → code                | MODI → VALI → MIMR → SAGA            |

### Direct (single skill)

Call a worker's slash command (`/vali`, `/mimr`, etc.) when you only want that one stage. The
worker still boots through the manifest + memory adapter and records its own run, but you own the
sequencing.

> **Why order matters:** MODI must turn placeholders into real instances before layout can be
> analysed; VALI may ungroup/wrap nodes, so it must run before MIMR binds tokens to them; tokens
> must be bound before SAGA can derive CSS variables. Running out of order risks lost bindings.

## 6. Worked examples

### 6.1 Wireframe → real components (MODI)

```
/modi
https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>/Wireframe?node-id=8914-78154
parse
```

MODI scans the frame, detects placeholder shapes (and reads any overlapping/sibling TEXT label as
a name hint), resolves each to an FDS component, shows you a swap plan, and on confirmation swaps
them in place — preserving each placeholder's sizing.

### 6.2 Groups → Auto Layout (VALI)

```
/vali
https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>/Screen?node-id=8373-54941
```

VALI classifies each frame as `section` / `group` / `pattern`, converts GROUPs and unwired FRAMEs
to Auto Layout, names them `{direction / role}`, and binds gap tokens. It shows the Phase 1
analysis and asks before writing.

### 6.3 Token audit + bulk write (MIMR)

```
/mimr
https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>/FDS-Card?node-id=17551-129450
```

MIMR audits Token Studio (TS) and native-variable (NV) bindings across the variants, reports
conflicts and missing bindings, and — when you approve a write plan — applies token bindings in
bulk using its mapping rules. Needs your PAT (see [§2.2](#22-a-figma-personal-access-token-pat)).

### 6.4 Component → Storybook (SAGA)

```
/saga
https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>/FDS-Notification?node-id=...
```

SAGA fetches the design context, confirms output format and any named slots with you, then writes
a component folder under `src/components/fds-{name}/` with the `--fds-*` variables wired from the
MIMR pass.

### 6.5 Full pipeline (ODIN)

```
/odin-9000
https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>/NewComponent?node-id=...
```

ODIN runs the whole chain end to end, pausing only for required confirmations (write plans, model
escalation, slot names) and a final lesson-reconciliation prompt if any rule proposals are pending.

## 7. Controls

### ODIN controls

| Command         | Effect                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/odin lessons` | Run the lesson-reconciliation sweep standalone — promote pending rule proposals into the data files behind a gated prompt. Opens its own `open → close` run. |
| `/odin refine`  | Alias of `/odin lessons`.                                                                                                                                    |

These do no Figma work and skip the PAT/Figma pre-flight. See the self-improvement loop in
[../tech/INTERNALS.md](../tech/INTERNALS.md#8-self-improvement-loop-lesson-reconciliation).

### Kevin controls (narration persona)

Kevin changes _how_ responses are narrated, never _what_ the agent does. It is **on by default**.

```text
/kevin off                 # disable the persona for the rest of the session
/kevin on                  # re-enable after /kevin off
/kevin lite|normal|ultra   # switch verbosity at any time
```

On the first skill invocation per session Kevin asks once which mode to use (default: Normal),
then caches it. Technical data (node IDs, variant props, counts) stays 100% accurate in every
mode; Hermes housekeeping and git operations are always narrated in Ultra.

---

## 8. Session & PAT handling

- On the first run that needs a PAT, ODIN asks for it and writes `.odin-session` at the repo root:

  ```text
  PAT=figd_xxxx...
  LAST_FRAME=https://www.figma.com/design/...
  ```

- ODIN ensures `.odin-session` is in `.gitignore` before writing, so the token is never committed.
- On every later invocation the saved PAT and last frame are reused automatically — you are not
  asked again.
- **PAT expiry:** if the REST API returns `401`/`403`, ODIN deletes the stale `.odin-session` and
  asks for a fresh token.

> **Security — shared machines.** `.odin-session` stores the PAT in plaintext. On a shared host
> prefer not to persist it: export `FIGMA_PAT` for the session (or use an OS keychain) and skip the
> file. If the file is used, `chmod 600 .odin-session` so others can't read it, and revoke the
> token at figma.com if the machine is shared or lost.

## 10. FAQ

**Do I have to use `/odin-9000`, or can I call workers directly?**
Both work. `/odin-9000` plans and sequences for you and records run state; direct calls
(`/vali`, `/mimr`, …) run a single stage with you owning the order.

**Where does my PAT go?**
Into `.odin-session` (gitignored) at the repo root, referenced by file — never inlined into run
state or printed back. See [§8](#8-session--pat-handling).

**What is "lesson reconciliation"?**
After a run, ODIN can promote insights it recorded during work into the rule files that drive
behaviour — but only the ones you approve. Run it any time with `/odin lessons`. Details in
[../tech/INTERNALS.md](../tech/INTERNALS.md#8-self-improvement-loop-lesson-reconciliation).

**Can I turn off the persona?**
Yes — `/kevin off`. It only affects narration; results are identical.

**Where are generated components written?**
Under `src/components/fds-{name}/` (see existing components there for the shape SAGA emits).
